# permutations

### This program is a Python script which prints all the permutations of a string in alphabetical order.
### Alphabetical order means that digits < upper case letters < lower case letters.
### The sorting is done in ascending order
### The program accepts a file as the first argument.
### The file contains input strings, one per line.
### When you execute the program in terminal with "python permute.py" it will print the permutations of the string separate by commas in alphabetical order.
